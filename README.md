Following Rust By Practice 
https://practice.course.rs/variables.html

## Variables
- var declaration: use 'let' to declare vars
- print:  print!() println!() (println!() adds line afterwards)
- scope: defined by block of code that it was declared
- function: is a named blick of code that is reusable
- shadowing: allows a var to be re-declared in the same scope with same name
